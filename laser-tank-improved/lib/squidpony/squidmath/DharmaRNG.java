/**
 * An alteration to a RandomnessSource that attempts to produce values that are
 * perceived as fair to an imperfect user.
 * <p>
 * This takes a RandomnessSource, defaulting to a LightRNG, and uses it to
 * generate random values, but tracks the total and compares it to the potential
 * total of a generator of only numbers with a desired value (default 0.54, so
 * it compares against a sequence of all 0.54). If the current generated total
 * is too high or low compared to the desired total, the currently used seed is
 * possibly changed, the generated number is moved in the direction of the
 * desired fairness, and it returns that instead of the number that would have
 * pushed the current generated total beyond the desired threshold. The new
 * number, if one is changed, will always be closer to the desired fairness.
 * This is absolutely insecure for cryptographic purposes, but should seem more
 * "fair" to a player than a random number generator that seeks to be truly
 * random. You can create multiple DharmaRNG objects with different fairness
 * values and seeds, and use favorable generators (with fairness greater than
 * 0.54) for characters that need an easier time, or unfavorable generators if
 * you want the characters that use that RNG to be impeded somewhat. The name
 * comes from the Wheel of Dharma. This class currently will have a slight bias
 * toward lower numbers with many RNGs unless fairness is tweaked; 0.54 can be
 * used as a stand-in because 0.5 leans too low.
 *
 * <p>
 * You can get values from this generator with: {@link #nextDouble()},
 * {@link #nextInt()}, {@link #nextLong()}, and the bounded variants on each of
 * those.
 * <p>
 * You can alter the tracking information or requested fairness with
 * {@link #resetFortune()}, {@link #setFairness(double)}, and
 * {@link #getFairness()}.
